I have used HTML, CSS, boostrap, javascript and jquery for this individual project.
The content is divided into sidenav, enter page, and five pages.
The jscript was used to allow open and closing of sidenav which would allow the visitors to enjoy the background-image. 
First page was done with flexbox and bootstrap to allow visitors to enjoy the image and minimize the space for the introduction words.
I used cards to present the four golf courses I enjoyed the most in Southern California, also added link to the golf course websites.
Third page, I used google map to give visitors an idea of where the course is located.
Fourth page, planned on embedding Youtube video on learning to play golf, but was not successful.
Fifth page is the portfolio page but do not have any to present yet, so added countdown to April 1st.
Added link to my email and linkedin through the footer.
